# lgarron's Homebrew Tap

This [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) is meant to make it easy to install some of my software.

Example usage:

    # Make sure Homebrew is installed first:
    # https://brew.sh/

    brew tap lgarron/lgarron
    brew install --HEAD lgarron/lgarron/git-freeze

## Disclaimer

I'm using this for my own convenience. Please don't try to use it unless you know exactly how Homebrew taps work.
